I am a postdoctoral associate at MIT [https://www.csail.mit.edu/ Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory] working with [https://people.csail.mit.edu/dina Dina Katabi]. My current research interests include machine learning in health sensing, people-centric sensing, and human activity recognition.

I received my Ph.D. from [http://www.ntu.edu.sg Nanyang Technological University], Singapore in April 2017. My Ph.D. advisors were [https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/dniyato/ Dusit Niyato], [https://dleong.github.io Derek Leong], [http://mysmu.edu.sg/faculty/hptan/ Hwee-Pink Tan], and [http://people.sutd.edu.sg/~shaowei_lin/ Shaowei Lin]. I received my B.Eng. degree in computer systems engineering from [https://www.birzeit.edu/en Birzeit University], Palestine in 2011. I was a visiting researcher at [https://www.tcd.ie/ Trinity College Dublin], Ireland in the summer of 2015. Between 2010 and 2012, I was a software engineer working on developing robust web services, Ajax-based web components, and smartphone applications.
