== {{<i class="fas fa-user fa-lg"></i>}} Bio
I am an Associate Professor and ARC DECRA Fellow at the *University of Canberra*, Australia. Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the *Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)*, USA. I received a Ph.D. degree from *Nanyang Technological University (NTU)*, Singapore, and a B.Eng. degree in computer systems from *Birzeit University (BZU)*, Palestine.

== {{<i class="fas fa-square-root-alt fa-lg"></i>}} Research
I am currently interested in privacy-preserving sensing technologies that comply with data privacy regulations. I design and create novel Internet of things systems that leverage machine learning and convex optimization with applications in people-centric sensing, human activity recognition, and smart cities.
