~~~

I am an assistant professor at the Faculty of Science \& Technology. I design and create novel IoT systems that leverage both machine learning and convex optimization with applications in people-centric sensing, human activity recognition, and smart cities. 

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA. My doctoral research at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore was focused on optimizing the data collection in wireless sensor networks. After graduating with a B.Eng. degree in computer systems from Birzeit University, Palestine, I worked as a software engineer at a digital advertising startup and Cisco.
